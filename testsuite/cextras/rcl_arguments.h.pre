 * DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus

 *
 *		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
 *		behavioral differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
 *
 * LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
 *		API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
 *		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
 *		its use is discouraged.
 *
 *		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
 *
 * STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
 *		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
 *		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
 *
 *		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
 *		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
 *
 *		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
 *		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
 *		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
 *		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
 *
 * In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
 * function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
 * tools users add either the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
 * compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
 * used without a prototype in scope.

#define __AVAILABILITY__ 
 /*     
    These macros are for use in OS header files. They enable function prototypes
    and Objective-C methods to be tagged with the OS version in which they
    were first available; and, if applicable, the OS version in which they 
    became deprecated.  
     
    The desktop Mac OS X and iOS each have different version numbers.
    The __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING() macro allows you to specify both the desktop
    and iOS version numbers.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_2,__IPHONE_2_0)
    means the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.2 on the desktop
    and first available in iOS 2.0 on the iPhone.
    
    If a function is available on one platform, but not the other a _NA (not
    applicable) parameter is used.  For instance:
            __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_3,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.3, and it
    currently not implemented on the iPhone.

    At some point, a function/method may be deprecated.  That means Apple
    recommends applications stop using the function, either because there is a 
    better replacement or the functionality is being phased out.  Deprecated
    functions/methods can be tagged with a __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED()
    macro which specifies the OS version where the function became available
    as well as the OS version in which it became deprecated.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED(__MAC_10_0,__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was introduced in Mac OS X 10.0, then
    became deprecated beginning in Mac OS X 10.5.  On iOS the function 
    has never been available.  
    
    For these macros to function properly, a program must specify the OS version range 
    it is targeting.  The min OS version is specified as an option to the compiler:
    -mmacosx-version-min=10.x when building for Mac OS X, and -miphoneos-version-min=y.z
    when building for the iPhone.  The upper bound for the OS version is rarely needed,
    but it can be set on the command line via: -D__MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=10x0 for
    Mac OS X and __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED = y0z00 for iOS.  
    
    Examples:

        A function available in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            extern void mymacfunc() __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);


        An Objective-C method in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            @interface MyClass : NSObject
            -(void) mymacmethod __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);
            @end

        
        An enum available on the phone, but not available on Mac OS X:
        
            #if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
                enum { myEnum = 1 };
            #endif
           Note: this works when targeting the Mac OS X platform because 
           __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED is undefined which evaluates to zero. 
        

        An enum with values added in different iPhoneOS versions:
		
			enum {
			    myX  = 1,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 2.1 and later
			    myY  = 2,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
			    myZ  = 3,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
				...
		      Note: you do not want to use #if with enumeration values
			  when a client needs to see all values at compile time
			  and use runtime logic to only use the viable values.
			  

    It is also possible to use the *_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED in source code to make one
    source base that can be compiled to target a range of OS versions.  It is best
    to not use the _MAC_* and __IPHONE_* macros for comparisons, but rather their values.
    That is because you might get compiled on an old OS that does not define a later
    OS version macro, and in the C preprocessor undefined values evaluate to zero
    in expresssions, which could cause the #if expression to evaluate in an unexpected
    way.
    
        #ifdef __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
            // code only compiled when targeting Mac OS X and not iPhone
            // note use of 1050 instead of __MAC_10_5
            #if __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED < 1050
                // code in here might run on pre-Leopard OS
            #else
                // code here can assume Leopard or later
            #endif
        #endif

 *
 * > Number of characters written if successful or negative value if an error
 * > occurred.
 * > If the resulting string gets truncated due to buf_size limit, function
 * > returns the total number of characters (not including the terminating
 * > null-byte) which would have been written, if the limit was not imposed.
 *
 * If `NULL` and `0` are given for buffer and buffer_size respectively, the
 * size of the string that would be generated is returned.
 * Either snprintf() or _vscprintf() is used to calculate this value.
 *
 * \see snprintf()
 * \see _snprintf_s()
 * \return the number of bytes that would have been written given enough space, or
 * \return a negative number if there is an error, but unlike _snprintf_s(),

 * If this function is not called beforehand, then the first time the error

 *
 * This function may or may not allocate memory.
 * The system's thread-local storage implementation may need to allocate
 * memory, since it usually has no way of knowing how much storage is needed
 * without knowing how many threads will be created.
 * Most implementations (e.g. C11, C++11, and pthread) do not have ways to
 * specify how this memory is allocated, but if the implementation allows, the
 * given allocator to this function will be used, but is otherwise unused.
 * This only occurs when creating and destroying threads, which can be avoided
 * in the "steady" state by reusing pools of threads.
 *
 * It is worth considering that repeated thread creation and destruction will
 * result in repeated memory allocations and could result in memory
 * fragmentation.
 * This is typically avoided anyways by using pools of threads.
 *
 * In case an error is indicated by the return code, no error message will have
 * been set.
 *
 * If called more than once in a thread, or after implicitly initialized by
 * setting the error state, it will still return `RCUTILS_RET_OK`, even
 * if the given allocator is invalid.
 * Essentially this function does nothing if thread-local storage has already
 * been called.
 * If already initialized, the given allocator is ignored, even if it does not
 * match the allocator used originally to initialize the thread-local storage.

 *   - `time`, the timestamp of log message in floating point seconds
 *   - `time_as_nanoseconds`, the timestamp of log message in integer nanoseconds
 *
 * The `RCUTILS_COLORIZED_OUTPUT` environment variable allows configuring if colours
